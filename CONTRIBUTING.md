# Contributing

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute üôå

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this library, these are mostly guidelines, not rules.

Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this [ How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) guide.

## Project setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```sh
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/olafsulich/use-haki.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

## How Can I Contribute?

### üêü New Hook

Have an awesome idea for next hook? Share it to the world!

1. Create `src/useYourHookName.ts` and run `npm start` to start the storybook development server and start coding your hook
2. Create `src/__tests__/useYourHookName.test.ts`, run `npm test:watch` to start the test runner in watch mode and start writing tests for your hook
3. Create `docs/useYourHookName.md` and create documentation for your hook, [HOOK_TEMPLATE here üëà](../HOOK_TEMPLATE.md)
4. Export your hook from `src/index.ts` and add your hook to `README.md`

You can also write your tests first if you prefer [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

### üç§ Improve existing hook

Do you have an idea how to improve one of existing hooks?

1. Run `npm start` and start applying changes
2. Update tests according to your changes using `npm test:watch`
3. Update documentation according to your changes

### :dog: Git hooks

There are git hooks set up with this project that are automatically enabled when you install dependencies. These hooks automatically test and validate your code when creating commits. They're really handy but can be temporarily disabled by adding a --no-verify flag to your commit command. This is useful when you want to commit and push to get feedback on uncompleted code.
